EASy

Premise: Easy is a virtual reality banking service that authorizes user login using ML, and displays information in 3D space. 

Goals: The goal of this product is to draw users into the otherwise intimidating interface of banking. The product accepts a user signature and analyzes it using ML services from Microsoft Azure. Upon a successful login the user is able to interact with their account in 3D space, choosing the information to view, and viewing and manipulating it in 3D space.

Implementation: This would make sense to be implemented in a Captial One cafe, as technology could be available to all users then. Eventually with the progression of VR and AR technology, this could become more available to the general public.
